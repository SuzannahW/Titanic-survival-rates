# Titanic Data
## What factors meant that people were more likely to survive?

It is relatively well known that a higher percentage of women passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic, but are there other factors, such as class, or age, that were also important in the likelyhood that a passenger would survive?

This project is an exploration of the passenger information data curated from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew onboard the Titanic. It contains demographics and passenger information and can be obtained from the Kaggle website [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

Data analysis was carried out using NumPy and Pandas, and Matplotlib was used to visualise the results.
